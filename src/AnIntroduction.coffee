#   * [Examples](examples.html)
#   * Unit Tests: [Run](../tests/index.html), [Source](https://github.com/curran/canvas-vis/tree/master/tests/spec)
#
# The project was just recently started in April 2013, and is not yet usable.
#
# Canvas-vis consists of a set of [AMD](http://requirejs.org/) modules written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) that leverage [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) and [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/).
#
# Modules assume Backbone and Underscore are loaded as script tags and expose the globals `Backbone` and `_`.
