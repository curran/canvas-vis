# Canvas-Vis Examples
# ===================
#
# This docrment is a collection of examples that use the Canvas-vis library. This file is built from `examples.coffee` in `build.sh`, which uses [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/). Because Docco supports [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) with inline HTML in comments, it is possible to execute `examples.coffee` within this document, producing running examples right next to their source code. Enjoy! --Curran Kelleher, April 2013
